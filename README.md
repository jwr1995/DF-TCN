# Utterance Weighted Multi-Dilation Temporal Convolutional Network (WD-TCN)

 This respository contains the WD-TCN mask estimation network code from our paper "Utterance Weighted Multi-Dilation Temporal Convolutional Networks for Monaural Speech Dereverberation". The code is designed to replace the TCN MaskNet from the SpeechBrain project which documentation is provided for at: https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/speechbrain.lobes.models.conv_tasnet.html#speechbrain.lobes.models.conv_tasnet.MaskNet
